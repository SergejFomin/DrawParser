# DrawParser
A simple attempt to implement an ANN/NN (Artificial Neural Network) from the ground up and use the classification of drawn digits to utilize the NN.

After building the application, it will not directly work.
It will be initialized with a clean slate of weights and biases and will require training and training data to classify the written digits.
